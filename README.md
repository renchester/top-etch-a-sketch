# The Odin Project

## Project: Etch-a-sketch

**Live version** of the game can be found [here](https://renchester.github.io/top-etch-a-sketch/)

This is a virtual recreation of the classic etch-a-sketch toy, allowing users to draw on a canvas--filling each pixel one at a time. This program allows you to draw using random, warm, and cool colors in addition to the default color. The size of the canvas can also be customized depending on your preference.
